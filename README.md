# Launchpad Helpers

This project contains a set of helper scripts which I have found useful for everyday life as a developer hacking code on Launchpad with Bazaar. At the moment it contains these scripts.

## lp-file-bug

A script to file simple, uncluttered bugs from the command line. Just give it the name of the bug and the project and it will prompt you to enter a description. Use `lp-file-bug --help` for usage

## lp-propose-merge

A script to propose a merge in Launchpad with one command. It will prompt for a description of the merge but that's about it. Use `lp-propose-merge --help` to see other options.
